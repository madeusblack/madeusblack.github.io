        <h1>Hello and welcome to my little space on the internet</h1>
        <p><strong>First of all i have to present myself</strong> <br> 
            my name it's <strong>Yayson Olivares</strong> i am a human being who expects <br>
           in some point of his life contribute to the outer space<br> 
           industry with the power of the <strong>code</strong><br> 
           at this moment i am studing by myself web technologies such as: <br>
           <ul>
               <li class="average">Javascript</li>
               <li class="average">CSS</li>
               <li class="average">HTML</li>
               <li class="underAverage">Webpack</li>
               <li class="underAverage">Node.js</li>
               <li class="underAverage">ReactJs</li>
           </ul>

               <li>Team-player (i love to teach and share knoledge)</li>
               <li>High Performance Under Pressure (basically my best learning sphere until now was during one of the worst world pandemics)</li>

               <li>Proactive (i think that if you are in tech industry you must be constantly learning)</li>
               
           </ul>
        </p>
