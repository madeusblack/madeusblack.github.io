        <h1 class="title">Hello and welcome to my little space on the internet</h1>
        <p><strong>First of all i have to present myself</strong> <br> 
            my name it's <strong>Yayson Olivares</strong> i am a human being who expects <br>
            in some point of his life contribute to the outer space<br> 
            industry with the power of the <strong>code</strong><br> 
            at this moment i am studing by myself web technologies such as: <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="average">Git</li>
            <li class="average">GitHub</li>
            <li class="average">Javascript</li>
            <li class="average">CSS</li>
            <li class="average">HTML</li>
            <li class="underAverage">Webpack</li>
            <li class="underAverage">Node.js</li>
            <li class="underAverage">ReactJs</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>And by my soft skills side i can tell this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Team-player (i love to teach and share knowledge that i think that it's relevant )</li>
            <li>High Performance Under Pressure (basically my best learning sphere until now was during one of the worst world pandemics)</li>
            <li>Calm Mind Under Chaos (applies the same example than in the point II)</li>
            <li>Proactive (i think that if you are in tech industry you must be constantly learning , also applies to life in general)</li>
               
        </ul>
        
        </div>
        <script src="index.js"></script>
